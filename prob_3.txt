#3  If you could change 1 thing about your favorite framework/language/platform (pick one), what would it be?

	If I could change one thing about Python, it would definitely be the privacy aspect. Python lacks any real kind of 
private variables, with only __variables being hidden from the listing function, but still changeable from any scope. In the
backend, this doesn't matter TOO much because all the calculations are handled off of client computers, but it'd be a great
quality of life feature for PiP releases or similar small scripts. A big argument against this is that with the pointers stored,
private variables aren't safe in any language, but most of internet security is adding hurdles, not creating impenetrable systems.
	The only other thing I would change is function inputs, because overloading function with the same number of variables and the 
memory reference problems with defaulting an array can be a headache. But they exist because Python is such a flexible language so 
it's with the territory.
